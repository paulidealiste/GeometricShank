## GEOMETRIC SHANK

Geometric explorations of text via cut-up method spiced up by free-path and single word slices. 

Sounds delicious?

### Geometric shank approach to text

This is primarilly a tool for artistic and clairvoyant explorations of one's own text or possibly some notevorthy novel :). It's three panel design provides a linear path to non-linear results. Namely, from left to right, the text box, the cut-up panel and the results panel, follow the destiny of the inbound text, from inception through transformation to fruition.

### Quick start

Paste-in or type any text, but be careful about inspirational flow, since the number of characters is limited to approx. one screen. Also, text can be sourced from a .txt file, or from an internal Public Domain copy of Immanuel Kant's Critique of pure reason. Random excrept can then be  obtained from it (popular victim file). After that, use the available tools to cut, path-cut or pick the words.

### Project status and downloads :radioactive:

Open-source and forever free, this companion is in its infancy and hopefully will see many more iterations. If there is a contributing impulse to this DADA, William Burroughs and Brion Gysin hommage all forms and shapes of help are welcome.

For contributors and fellow DADA inspired developers this repo can be cloned and worked on with one speck of yarn install.
```
git clone https://github.com/paulidealiste/GeometricShank.git
yarn

yarn dev #in one terminal window
yarn electron #in another terminal window after dev finishes

```

:warning:
After the required packages update (*vue* and *vite* instead of *webpack*) build step for the installable release is still not working.

### Hopes and dreams

Avoid all slang. Go back to words. Software like a streamlined creative process, with an emphasis on the burden of future events. Strong non-utilitarian message. Counterculture.

### Help

Since this is an intial release, Geometric Shank is releatively (ahem. completely) in isolation. That is not the way its existence was intended. Its goal covers many areas so any help in the following would be invaluable:
* Geometric Shank usage and the variaty (or lack thereof) of cut-up results.
* Artistic touches, design and re-design.
* New features from ideas to programming.
* Bug hunt.
* Distribution and an eventual website.    
    
In the spirit of the Beat generation, woud it be too much to fixate on a posibillty of a fanzine-type software, which embodies the content and the tool in one neat, freely shareable package?
